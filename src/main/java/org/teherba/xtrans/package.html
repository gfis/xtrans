<a target="_top" href="/webapps/xtrans/"><strong>xtrans</strong></a>    generates and consumes XML, SAX events and various Internet, office and legacy file formats
    (among them Base64, Quoted Printable, Hexdump, IBM z/OS JCL, DTA, Datev, SWIFT, Separated/Delimited,
    Morse Code, LDIF, Navy DIF, ICalendar, popular programming languages). 
    By design all classes aim to be totally symmetrical, that is they should
    produce the same result when a format is converted to XML and then back to the format.
    In most cases this is accomplished to the byte level, and in the remaining cases
    the result of a
    generate - XML - serialize cycle differs from the original in the amount of whitespace only.
    They transfomers can be used as start and end points 
    in XML processing pipelines.
